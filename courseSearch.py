#the idea with this file was to scrape a website for course information
#so that if the database doesnt have the information available it could
#use this file to get the information from the website

#can work out this more later but right now (18/02) there isnt an easy 
#way for me to handle the users input of a golf course and be able to
#search that on the website since there isnt a consistent url for each
#course on the website.
